placepuppy is a placeholder image generator written in PHP.

placepuppy is a hobby project, born as a gift for a friend (and what's better
than some puppy-cuteness?) and continued as a mean to explore PHP, CSS, HTML 
and other web technologies.

Some features:
* some basic responsive layout
* clean URIs
* event logging

In it you will probably not find the best solution to your problems, you also
may find some choices objectionable (e.g. why have you used a database for 
this?); but I hope you can use it as a mean to learn and have the same fun I 
had while writing it.

== DETAILS ==
All the work is done by the following files:
* code.php
* error.php
Take also a moment to look at '.htaccess' file.

Please note that you need:
* a configuration file named 'config.ini' is needed to read the credentials 
  for your database. This file should not be publicly available, for instance
  it should stay outside of your web root. 'code.php' assumes it is in its
  parent directory.
* 'log4php' logging library, you can get it at:
      http://logging.apache.org/log4php/
   please note that  the code assumes the source for 'Logger.php'
   is in a directory named 'log4php' in the parent directory of 'code.php'
   See http://logging.apache.org/log4php/install.html for more detailed
   installation information
* a logger configuration file named 'logger-config.xml' placed in the parent
  directory of 'code.php'

== AUTHORS ==

This site Would not have been possible without the help and advice of Chiara
"Melian" in choosing the photos.

The code in 'code.php' and '.htaccess' is derived from "Dynamic Dummy Image" 
by Russell Heimlich.
